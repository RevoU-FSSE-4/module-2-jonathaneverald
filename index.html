            Dota 2 is a 2013 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game
            by Valve. The game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), a
            community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III:
            Reign of Chaos. Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of
            five players, with each team occupying and defending their own
            separate base on the map. Each of the ten players independently
            controls a powerful character known as a "hero" that all have unique
            abilities and differing styles of play. During a match players
            collect experience points and items for their heroes to defeat the
            opposing team's heroes in player versus player combat. A team wins
            by being the first to destroy the other team's "Ancient", a large
            structure located within their base.
          </p>
          <p>
            Development of Dota 2 began in 2009 when IceFrog, lead designer of
            Defense of the Ancients, was hired by Valve to design a modernized
            remake in the Source game engine. It was released for Windows, OS X,
            and Linux via the digital distribution platform Steam in July 2013,
            following a Windows-only open beta phase that began two years prior.
            The game is fully free-to-play with no heroes or any other gameplay
            element needing to be bought or otherwise unlocked. To maintain it,
            Valve supports the game as a service, selling loot boxes and a
            battle pass subscription system called Dota Plus that offer
            non-gameplay altering virtual goods in return, such as hero
            cosmetics and audio replacement packs. The game was ported to the
            Source 2 engine in 2015, making it the first game to use it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dota 2 has a large esports scene, with teams from around the world
            playing in various professional leagues and tournaments. Valve
            organizes the Dota Pro Circuit, which are a series of tournaments
            that award qualification points for earning direct invitations to
            The International, the game's premier tournament held annually.
            Internationals feature a crowdfunded prize money system that has
            seen amounts in upwards of US$40 million, making Dota 2 the most
            lucrative esport. Media coverage of most tournaments is done by a
            selection of on-site staff who provide commentary and analysis for
            the ongoing matches similar to traditional sporting events. In
            addition to playing live to audiences in arenas and stadiums,
            broadcasts of them are also streamed over the internet and sometimes
            simulcast on television, with several million in viewership numbers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite criticism going towards its steep learning curve and overall
            complexity, Dota 2 was praised for its rewarding gameplay,
            production quality, and faithfulness to its predecessor, with many
            considering it to be one of the greatest video games of all time. It
            has been one of the most played games on Steam since its release,
            with over a million concurrent players at its peak. The popularity
            of the game has led to merchandise and media adaptations, including
            comic books and an anime series, as well as promotional tie-ins to
            other games and media. The game allows for the community to create
            their own gamemodes, maps, and cosmetics, which are uploaded to the
            Steam Workshop. Two spinoff games, Artifact and Dota Underlords,
            were released by Valve. Dota 2 has been used in machine learning
            experiments, with a team of bots known as the OpenAI Five showing
            the capability to defeat professional players.

        <h2>Dota 2 Facts</h2>
        <div class="dota-2-facts">
          <ul id="facts">
            <li>
              The mastermind behind this internet sensation is a person who goes
              by the name “IceFrog”. He began developing the game in 2005, and
              there is very little information available about him. He was born
              in 1983 or 1984.
            </li>
            <li>
              IceFrog once posted pictures of cats on the Playdota forum in
              2009. It was intended as a friendly post but earned him plenty of
              backlash. The Dota community complained of him spending time on
              leisure activities instead of updating the game. After the
              incident, he sealed himself away from the western world and only
              remained mildly active on his Weibo account in China.
            </li>
            <li>
              Most people know that Dota first began as a modification of
              WarCraft 3. However, it was inspired by the map ‘Aeon of Strife’
              in StarCraft, making that map the true legacy from which the
              popular gaming genre started.
            </li>
            <li>
              Creation of the game first began in 2003 when a pseudonymous
              designer “Eul” took charge. Many iterations of the game were
              subsequently found, but it was Dota: AllStars created by the later
              League of Legends game designer, Steve “Guinsoo” Feak, which truly
              captivated gamers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dota 2 was the most played game on Steam for the longest time.
              However, a year ago Players Unknown Battleground (PUBG) broke the
              record. PUBG became the most played game on Steam on 26th August
              2018. Dota 2 also had the highest hours played for any game, which
              most people considered unbeatable until PUBG surpassed it.
            </li>
            <li>
              The International is the biggest Dota 2 tournament in the world.
              Each edition of The International has surpassed the previous one
              in growing prize pools, and it has always offered the highest
              prize takeaways among esport tournaments.
